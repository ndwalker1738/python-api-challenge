In this data analysis(WeatherPy), we took a closer look at the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. We observed the relationships between latitude versus cloudiness, latitude versus humidity, latitude versus temperature, and latitude versus windiness. As the latitude approaches 0 or gets closer to the Equator the temperature increases. As the latitude increases and gets farther away from 0 the temperature decreases. In the Northern Hemisphere there is a negative linear relationship latitude versus temperature . In the Southern Hemisphere there is a positive linear relationship Latitude versus Temperature. Positive linear relationship latitude vs humidity in Northern and Southern Hemisphere. Positive linear relationship latitude vs cloudiness in Southern and Northern Hemisphere Negative linear relationship latitude vs wind speed in North and South Hemisphere.
In the 2nd part of the data analysis (VacationPy) we use the weather information we gathered to determine a good vacation spot.
Disclaimer: For some reason, my code didnt find any hotels in any of the locations and I got several tutors to look at my code.
